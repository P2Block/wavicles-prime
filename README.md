# P2Block DATUM Prime (`primed`)

The pool side of the DATUM protocol for the BLAKE2b Bitcoin chain (BTCB2), as run by
**[P2Block](https://p2block.com)** (`datum.p2block.com:28915`, 1 % with your own gateway,
2 % on the hosted stratum). This is a fork of
[GaltRanch/wavicles-prime](https://github.com/GaltRanch/wavicles-prime) (PyBLØCK's WAVICLES
Prime), which is itself Lazarus `primed` plus the window-snapshot commitment and carry-forward
described below. Everything P2Block added is listed in
[P2Block modifications](#p2block-modifications); the protocol, the TIDES rule and the gateways
supported are unchanged, so any stock `datum_gateway` or `ratum-gateway` points at this Prime
unpatched.

Any stock `datum_gateway` — OCEAN, [CONVOY](https://github.com/CONVOYMining/datum_gateway),
the BLAKE2b forks by [FlyTheElephant1](https://github.com/FlyTheElephant1/datum_gateway) and
[iohzrd](https://github.com/iohzrd/datum_gateway), or the packaged
[StartOS](https://github.com/Retropex/datum-gateway-startos/releases) build — and
[ratum-gateway](https://github.com/iohzrd/ratum) point at this Prime (see
[Supported gateways](#supported-gateways)). The gateway's own node builds every block
template. The Prime never sees or chooses transactions; it does three things:

1. **Dictates the coinbase.** When a gateway asks for a coinbaser, the Prime answers with the
   current TIDES split of the window: one output per miner, proportional to work, after the pool
   fee, then the pool's own output last so the list sums to the requested value. The gateway
   builds its coinbase from that list, so a block found by anyone's miner pays everyone in the
   window.
2. **Verifies every share.** Each share is rebuilt into a full BLAKE2b header v2 from the job
   the gateway described (prevhash, nbits, merkle branches, coinbase halves) and the miner's
   nonce fields, hashed, and checked against the share target — and against the network target,
   so a block is recognised before the gateway says so. The coinbase inside the share is parsed
   and compared with the split the Prime actually issued for that job; a coinbase paying anywhere
   else is rejected.
3. **Keeps the ledger.** Accepted work is credited to the miner's payout address in an
   append-only window sized in multiples of network difficulty. On a block, the split that was
   paid (or, for a stock gateway's pool-only "empty" coinbase, the amount the pool now owes the
   window) is recorded, and the Prime submits the assembled block to its own node too.

## P2Block modifications

Branch `p2block` = upstream `GaltRanch/wavicles-prime` at the pinned commit + the commits below.
Builds are tagged `p2block-vX.Y.Z`; the pool's `pool-primed` image is built from that tag.

### Runtime controls (`<data-dir>/controls.json`)

The pool's control plane (poolcore, from the `/admin` console) writes this file; the Prime
re-reads it within 5 s of any change. Nothing here needs a restart.

```json
{
  "fee_bps": 100,                       // live DATUM-tier fee; null/absent = prime.toml fee-bps
  "stratum_fee_bps": 200,               // live hosted-tier fee; null/absent = prime.toml stratum-fee-bps
  "fee_overrides": { "bc1q…": 50 },     // per payout address, applies on BOTH paths (partners, promotions)
  "banned_identities": ["bc1q…"],       // every share from these identities is refused, nothing credited
  "banned_ips": ["203.0.113.9", "198.51.100.0/24"],   // sessions from these addresses are refused at accept
  "updated": "2026-09-15T04:00:00Z"
}
```

Rules: fees are basis points, 0–10000; override keys are canonicalised like usernames (bech32
lowercased, `.worker` stripped); unknown keys are rejected. A file that fails validation is
logged and **ignored, keeping the previous controls in force**; a removed file returns to the
`prime.toml` values with no bans. Every reload is logged with a one-line summary.

### Per-identity fees in the split and in the commitment

`tides::SplitParams` gained `fee_overrides`; `bps_for(identity)` returns the (stratum, datum)
basis points that apply. The uncapped and the capped ("pay like CHIRP") paths both honour it,
and the capped fee is computed exactly per identity. The **window snapshot is now v2**:
`params.fee_overrides` is committed alongside the tier fees and the rule text names it, so a
block paying someone a different rate is still reproducible from the chain.
`tools/verify_wavicles_block.py` recomputes v2 snapshots (and applies the hosted-tier rate to
`stratum_work` on every path, as the Prime does).

### Per-worker stats for DATUM-tier miners

A miner behind their own gateway is one identity to the pool, but the gateway forwards the
full stratum username. The Prime now keeps `(identity, worker)` counters — accepted, work,
last share, a 10-minute hashrate — and exposes them as `workers[]` in `stats.json`. Entries
expire after an hour of silence. The pool's dashboard shows them as per-rig rows next to the
hosted-tier ones.

### `stats.json` additions

`pool.fee_bps` / `pool.stratum_fee_bps` are the **effective** values (`pool.config_fee_bps` /
`pool.config_stratum_fee_bps` keep the file values); every `window.miners[]` row carries its
`fee_bps` / `stratum_fee_bps`; `controls` summarises what is loaded; `workers[]` as above.

### Keeping up with upstream

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GaltRanch/wavicles-prime
git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main p2block      # our commits are few and self-contained
cargo test && cargo fmt --all -- --check
git tag p2block-vX.Y.Z && git push --force-with-lease origin p2block && git push origin p2block-vX.Y.Z
```

Then bump `WAVICLES_REF` in the pool repo's `deploy/images/primed/Dockerfile`. Generic pieces
(the controls file, per-worker stats) are candidates for upstream pull requests; the fee
override and ban policy are P2Block's.

## WAVICLES (upstream: PyBLØCK)

Upstream is the Prime behind **WAVICLES**, PyBLØCK's DATUM pool. It is Lazarus `primed` plus
two things that make the TIDES split verifiable from the chain and keep the pool from ever
holding a balance for anyone (both kept unchanged here):

* **Window-snapshot commitment.** Every coinbaser is computed from a window state; that state
  (identities and work, carry, parameters, the resulting split) is serialized as canonical JSON,
  hashed with BLAKE2b-256, and committed as the first output of the coinbaser:
  `OP_RETURN <snapshot-tag> || hash` (zero sats). The snapshot is published at
  `/snapshot/<hash>` on the stats port. `tools/verify_wavicles_block.py --height H` checks that
  the block's commitment hashes the published snapshot, recomputes the split from it, and
  compares every output on chain by scriptPubKey. What still rests on the pool is that the
  window reflects the shares gateways really sent; signed share receipts are the next step.
* **Carry-forward instead of "owed".** What a coinbase could not pay — dust under the minimum
  payout, outputs a gateway's coinbase class dropped, or a block found on an empty window — is
  recorded per identity in `carry.json` once the block settles and paid by the next coinbases
  out of the pool's own output, fee included. The pool nets exactly its fee over time and never
  custodies payouts. `stats.json` exposes it under `wavicles.carry`.

Config keys: `commit-snapshot`, `snapshot-tag`, `carry-forward` (all on by default). The wire
format, the gateways supported and the TIDES rule are unchanged; a stock gateway pays the
OP_RETURN like any other dictated output.

## Layout

```
prime/
  Cargo.toml          workspace
  wire/               datum-wire: framing, NaCl session, messages, coinbaser v2, BLAKE2b PoW, share verify
  tides/              tides: share window, split computation, append-only ledger, block log
  primed/             the daemon: sessions, node poller, stats HTTP, CLI
  prime.toml.example
  scripts/regtest-e2e.sh          end-to-end test against a real C datum_gateway on regtest
  scripts/regtest-divergence.sh   two-node test: gateway template survives a pool node with a different mempool/tip
```

`datum-wire` and `tides` have no async or I/O dependencies beyond `std`; every protocol and
accounting rule is unit-tested in isolation. `primed` is the only crate that touches sockets.

## Build and run

```bash
cd prime
cargo build --release
cp prime.toml.example prime.toml      # edit payout-address, data-dir, rpc, rpc-cookie
target/release/primed -c prime.toml check
target/release/primed -c prime.toml pubkey   # give this to gateway operators
target/release/primed -c prime.toml run
```

Subcommands: `run` (default), `check`, `pubkey`, `window` (dump the window as JSON),
`import-ledger <ledger.json>` (seed an empty window from the previous Prime's export).
Logging is `RUST_LOG` (`info` default; `debug` prints each share decision).

### Taking over from `lazarus-prime`

An existing `lazarus-prime.toml` loads unchanged (`activation-height`, `verify-shares` and
`require-split-gateway` are accepted and reported as no longer applying). A data dir the old
Prime left behind keeps its identity: `lazarus-prime.key` (its 160-byte layout) is read when
there is no `prime.key`, so the pool pubkey every gateway operator pinned stays the same —
`primed pubkey` prints it to confirm. (P2Block runs a fresh key; the section is kept for operators migrating an old Prime.) Its `ledger.json` is the whole window; import it before
the first `run`:

```bash
primed -c lazarus-prime.toml import-ledger /path/to/lazarus-prime/ledger.json
primed -c lazarus-prime.toml run
```

This is how the Lazarus pool was cut over on 2026-09-03: same key, same config, 9,021 credit
rows / 570.5 M work / 18 identities imported, `lazarus-gateway` reconnected within a second,
and its shares verified against the same window. Expect a short burst of
`bad-coinbase-outputs` rejects right after any Prime restart: a gateway keeps publishing jobs
built on the coinbaser it got from the previous instance until its next template, and a
coinbase paying a split this instance never issued is refused by design.

### Gateway side

In `datum_gateway_config.json`:

```json
"datum": {
  "pool_host": "datum.p2block.com",
  "pool_port": 28915,
  "pool_pubkey": "<output of primed pubkey>",
  "pool_pass_workers": true,
  "pool_pass_full_users": true,
  "pooled_mining_only": true
}
```

`mining.pool_address` should be the pool's payout address (a stock gateway sends anything
its template is worth beyond the issued list there). Miners authenticate to the gateway as
`<payout address>.<worker>`; the address is the identity credited in the window. The
identity ends at the first `.` or `~`, so a `~modifier` suffix that a gateway without
`stratum_username_mod` forwards verbatim still credits the address. Nothing else changes for
the gateway operator.

The pool's own public stratum, `lazarus-gateway` (in `../lazarus/`), is a DATUM client too and
speaks to this Prime as one; two habits of its are recognised as such. It sends the whole
legacy coinbase as `coinb1` with an empty `coinb2` (a shape no stock gateway produces), and
when its template is worth less than the value a split was issued for it scales every output
down by the same ratio rather than dropping the ones that no longer fit.

## Supported gateways

Four upstreams, two protocol generations. The refs are what the e2e script builds, and are
the versions this Prime is checked against.

| Name | Upstream | Ref tracked | Generation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `convoy` | `CONVOYMining/datum_gateway` | `master` | Convoy, configure v3 |
| `fte` | `FlyTheElephant1/datum_gateway` | `test/console-collapse-pr14-pr17` (now also `master`) | OCEAN, configure v1 |
| `iohzrd` | `iohzrd/datum_gateway` | `master` (has the `blake2b` branch and two commits more) | OCEAN, configure v1 |
| `startos` | packaged by `Retropex/datum-gateway-startos` | the `datum_gateway` submodule of the newest `pow_*` release | OCEAN, configure v1 |

The StartOS package ships the gateway as a submodule, so a release pins one gateway commit
rather than naming a branch. `scripts/regtest-e2e.sh startos` resolves that commit from the
release and builds it, which keeps the test honest as new packages ship. Its unreleased
`pow-convoy` branch is Convoy-lineage and reachable as `startos-convoy`.

Two upstream rules are load-bearing and are enforced here rather than discovered in
production:

* **RDTS output scripts.** Knots activates RDTS (BIP 110) as a flag day at the BLAKE2b fork
  height, which limits every output of the generation transaction to a 34-byte scriptPubKey
  (83 if it starts with `OP_RETURN`). The newest gateways enforce it too: an oversized miner
  payout is left out of the coinbase, and an oversized *pool* payout stops them serving work
  for the block at all. `address::to_script` therefore treats an address whose output script
  cannot fit — a witness program over 32 bytes is valid but does not — as unpayable, so its
  share stays in the pool remainder instead of becoming an output a gateway would drop. An
  unpayable `payout-address` is refused at startup.
* **The ABW flag.** Convoy's configure v3 carries a flags byte, and this pool sets
  `ABW_DISABLED` because it runs no anti-withholding. Convoy builds from 2026-09-02 onward
  require it: without it the gateway waits for an assignment that never comes and serves no
  work. Convoy-lineage builds from *before* that date reject a non-zero flags byte outright,
  so they need a gateway update rather than a change here. Only the unreleased `pow-convoy`
  branch is still pinned that far back; every published StartOS package is OCEAN-lineage and
  never sees this byte.

## Protocol

Recovered from the C client; the same bytes any gateway already speaks.

* **Frame**: 4-byte header, one little-endian `u32`: `len:22 | reserved:2 | signed | sealed |
  channel | cmd:5`, XOR-obfuscated by a per-direction rolling key (`feedback`, a Murmur3-style
  mix reseeded from the hello). Payloads are plaintext, NaCl sealed boxes, or `crypto_box` on
  the session keys, optionally trailed by an ed25519 signature.
* **Handshake**: client sends a `crypto_box_seal`ed hello containing its long-term and session
  keys, user agent, and a seed; Convoy-lineage clients append `DRS\x01` and an optional resume
  token. The Prime replies sealed to the session key with its MOTD and the seed acknowledgement.
  The generation is detected from the hello, and the matching **configure** layout is sent:
  v1 (32-bit prime id) for OCEAN/fte/iohzrd, v3 (64-bit id, resume token, `ABW_DISABLED`) for
  Convoy.
* **Mining command (0x05)**: coinbaser request → coinbaser v2 reply (`id | (value u64,
  script len, script)…`); pow submit with lazily-attached job (0x01) and coinbase (0x02) sections, the
  BLAKE2b section (0x03: 64-bit ntime and nonce) and the header time (0x04); share receipts
  with the client's reject-code vocabulary; block notify; full-block request and the
  transaction reply.
* **Lineage quirks handled**: 8 vs 256 job slots; `FLAG_BLAKE2B` set (fte/Convoy) or implied by
  the 0x03 section alone (iohzrd); 12-byte extranonce with `b10cf00d` marker; `sia_prevhash`
  form of the previous block.

### BLAKE2b header v2

A share is verified by reproducing exactly what Knots hashes:

```
H1     = tagged_sha256("Bitcoin block header 1",
           version‖prev‖height‖merkle_root‖time‖00‖nbits‖txcount‖flags‖clear_bits‖tagged(xor_key))
H2     = tagged_sha256("Merge-mining hook", H1 ‖ 32 zero bytes ‖ rhs)      the job commitment
coinb1 = 000000 ‖ H2 ‖ 00000000                                            39 bytes, Sia layout
root   = blake2b256(0x00 ‖ coinb1 ‖ extranonce(12))                        what the ASIC calls the merkle root
work   = hidden_prev(32) ‖ nonce(8) ‖ ntime(8) ‖ root(32)                  the 80-byte ASIC pass
hash   = reverse(blake2b256(work) XOR mask(xor_key, clear_bits))
```

`hash <= share_target(pot)` credits `2^pot` work; `hash <= nbits_target` is a block. The
Bitcoin merkle root folds the coinbase txid over the gateway-supplied branches; the coinbase
is `coinb1 ‖ 12 zero bytes ‖ coinb2` with the target byte patched in. A per-connection
`JobSlot` caches the parsed coinbase and the H2 for each `(coinbase id, target byte)`, so a
repeat share on the same job costs one BLAKE2b, not a coinbase parse, a merkle fold, and two
tagged SHA256s.

## TIDES

The window holds credits `(ts, identity, work, height)` until its total work reaches
`window × network difficulty` (converted to difficulty-1 shares), then trims from the oldest
end. A split of value `V` pays `fee = V × fee_bps / 10000` to the pool, then distributes the
rest to identities proportional to their work in the window, dropping outputs below
`min-payout` (their share stays with the pool and is reported as unpaid). The output list is
capped by count and size so the coinbase fits in a gateway's largest coinbase class, with the
pool's output — fee plus whatever could not be placed — appended last. The list therefore
sums to the requested value; a stock gateway pays it verbatim and only adds a pool output of
its own when the template turns out to be worth more, and `lazarus-gateway`, which writes
exactly the list it is given, pays the fee instead of burning it.

Stock gateways build several coinbase sizes and hand small miners those with room for only
the first few outputs, or none at all while a coinbaser reply is in flight. The Prime
classifies every share's coinbase as **Split** (every issued miner output paid), **Partial**
(a subset, each in full), **PoolOnly** (only the pool's script), or **Foreign** (anything
else, rejected). An output is "paid" when it carries at least the issued amount scaled by
`actual value / issued value` when the template is worth less than the split assumed (never
more than issued) — this covers both a gateway that scales the list and one that drops
outputs. The pool's own output is exempt from any minimum; it takes what is left. A block
found on a Partial or PoolOnly coinbase records `owed_sats` — what the pool holds on behalf of
the window — in `blocks.jsonl`.

### On disk (`data-dir`)

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `prime.key` | ed25519 seed ‖ x25519 secret, 0600, generated once (`lazarus-prime.key` is read instead when present) |
| `controls.json` | P2Block runtime controls (live fees, per-identity overrides, bans), written by the pool's control plane |
| `credits.bin` | append-only 24-byte credit rows; replayed at start, compacted when the window trims |
| `identities.txt` | interned identity table (one address per line, index = row id) |
| `window.json` | window target work and lifetime counters |
| `blocks.jsonl` | one JSON line per block event (candidate, submit outcome, settled/orphaned) |
| `stats.json`, `ledger.json` | mirrors of the HTTP endpoints, rewritten atomically |

## Stats

`GET /stats.json` on `stats-listen` (also mirrored to `data-dir/stats.json`) is the document the
pool UI reads: `pool` (pubkey, fee, window multiple, advertise address, uptime), `node`
(height, tip hash, difficulty, tip age), `window` (target/total work, fill percent, per-miner
`work`, `shares`, `hashrate_ghs`, `share_percent`, `payout_sats` at the current reward),
`clients` (per gateway: generation, user agent, accepted/rejected, last reject reason),
`blocks`, `owed`, `totals`, plus P2Block's `workers` and `controls` (see above). `/ledger.json`
is the previous Prime's credits view for the UI's hashrate graph; `/healthz` returns `ok`.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test                                  # wire (44), tides (15), primed (16)
cargo test --release -p primed --test replay_e2e -- --ignored --nocapture   # hostile gateway vs a real primed
scripts/regtest-e2e.sh convoy               # or fte | iohzrd | startos: real C gateway + real Knots on regtest
MINER_CMD='...' scripts/regtest-divergence.sh fte   # two nodes with different mempools and tips
```

`replay_e2e` starts a `primed`, speaks DATUM to it as a gateway would, grinds one genuine
diff-1 share (~2^32 BLAKE2b hashes, 10–60 s across all cores) and replays it fourteen ways —
job section flipped in an unread field, bare, on another slot, after a reconnect, from another
key — asserting it is credited exactly once. `PRIMED_BIN=/path/to/primed` points the same
attack at another build; against the pre-fix binary the first replay is accepted.

The unit tests pin the frame obfuscation, nonce derivation, hello round trip for both
generations, configure v1/v3 byte layouts, coinbaser v2, pow submit parse/encode, tagged
hashes, and share verification including grinding real BLAKE2b shares against an easy target.

The end-to-end script builds the named `datum_gateway`, points it at a `primed` on a local
BLAKE2b regtest node, and checks that the handshake, configure, coinbaser, shares, block
candidates and `submitblock` all happen. `convoy`, `fte`, `iohzrd` and `startos` all pass it at
the heads in the table above, each reaching handshake, configure and coinbaser against a real
Knots regtest node. `startos-convoy` fails on purpose: its pin predates Convoy's ABW flag, so
it rejects the configure and the script says so. Earlier,
a block found through a stock Convoy gateway paid the two-miner TIDES split on-chain
exactly as issued (65.6% / 34.4% after the 0.5% fee), and the block the Prime assembled from
the gateway's transaction reply was byte-identical to the one the gateway submitted. With the
complete list, a Convoy-found block's coinbase carried the miner's 12.4375 and the pool's
0.0625 (0.5%) once each — no second pool output.

### Template divergence

The e2e test runs the gateway and the Prime against the same node, so it cannot tell whether
the block the Prime submits is the gateway's template or something the pool's node would have
built. `regtest-divergence.sh` separates them: node A is the pool's node (the Prime submits
there), node B is the gateway's node, a fresh datadir synced from A. It cuts the two apart and
gives each transactions the other never sees (raw transactions signed by A's wallet but
broadcast only to B; wallet sends on A), so `getblocktemplate` differs on the two nodes at the
same height. It then mines through a stock `fte` gateway and asserts, from `getblock` on A:

* the block A accepted contains every B-only transaction and none of A's own — the pool node
  accepted a block it could not have built, so the Prime reassembled the gateway's template
  byte-for-byte rather than substituting its node's view;
* the coinbase carries the gateway's secondary tag (`Lazarus␏divergence-gw`) and the issued
  split (first block after start is `pool-only`, as the stock gateway publishes an empty
  coinbaser job until the first reply lands; the owed amount is recorded);
* the gateway's own node B has the same block, so both sides agree without ever talking.

Then it drifts the tips. With B one block behind A (A mines a block B never hears about), the
gateway's next solve is a competing block at A's tip height: the Prime accepts the share inside
`stale-grace-secs`, A answers `inconclusive` (valid, not best), the 30 s confirm pass labels the
record `orphan:split`, the next solve on B's branch reorgs A, and the label clears
(`back in the main chain`, record `split`, settled). Finally A and B are reconnected and must
agree. The whole run takes about a minute on regtest with a GPU miner.

Doing this by hand first surfaced three bugs, all fixed:

* a record labelled `orphan:` was never re-checked, so a competing block that later won the
  reorg — exactly the lagging-gateway-node case above — stayed an orphan forever, and the pool
  UI read orphan state from the wrong field (`submit` rather than `kind`);
* two block candidates solved on the *same job* (regtest does it every share; on mainnet it
  needs two solves of one job seconds apart) overwrote each other in the pending map, so the
  gateway's single transaction reply assembled and submitted only the later one. Every
  candidate for a job is now kept and submitted from the one transaction set;
* when the gateway's node is two or more blocks *ahead* of the pool's node, every share is
  rejected as stale (correct: the Prime cannot verify work on a chain its node has not seen, and
  a stock gateway then reconnects every 30 s for lack of accepts). That is a lagging pool node,
  not a stale gateway, and it is now logged as such once a minute per session.

## Design notes

* Verification is cheap enough that every share is fully rebuilt and checked, always. The
  ignored `verify_throughput` test measures both paths on a single core: on a Ryzen 9950X3D,
  about 376k shares/s for a share carrying fresh job + coinbase sections against a 2000-tx
  template, and about 536k shares/s for later shares on the same job
  (`cargo test --release -p datum-wire -- --ignored --nocapture verify_throughput`). A whole
  pool's share flow fits on one core with orders of magnitude to spare.
* One Tokio task per connection owns both halves of the socket; reads go through a
  cancel-safe growable buffer so `select!` over reads, tip broadcasts and keepalives can never
  desynchronise the frame stream.
* The ledger is a `Mutex` held only for the microseconds a credit takes; nothing awaits under
  it. Coinbaser replies compute the split from a snapshot.
* Block notify is fanned out with a broadcast channel; a tip change from the node poller or a
  block candidate from any session reaches every other gateway immediately.
* Idle gateways get a zero-length INFO frame every 20 s (the client's global timeout is 60 s);
  a gateway silent for 300 s is dropped. Handshake must complete in 15 s.
* Duplicate shares are caught by hash in one set shared by every session and keyed by block
  height. The hash commits to the job (prev, merkle, nBits, txcount, version) and the miner's
  nonces, so it is unique per height and needs no per-job scoping; nothing a gateway sends —
  a re-sent job section, a reconnect, a new key — can empty it. Housekeeping prunes heights
  below what the stale check still accepts, and at a hard cap new work is refused rather than
  old work forgotten. (Before 2026-09-06 the set was per session and per job and was cleared
  whenever the job section changed, which let one share be credited without limit.) Shares one
  height behind are accepted for `stale-grace-secs` after the tip moved, matching template
  refresh latency.
* The coinbase check bounds miner outputs from both sides. An issued output may not be paid
  *less* than its share (scaled down when the template is worth less than the split assumed)
  and may not be paid *more* than Prime issued against its script (scaled up by the same ratio
  when the template is worth more, which is how `lazarus-gateway` rescales). The upper bound
  is what stops a gateway paying every miner exactly and sending the pool's remainder — fee,
  rounding, unplaced dust — to an address of its own choosing; it is held per script, not per
  identity, because two window identities may resolve to one scriptPubKey.
* Identities are folded before interning: a bech32 address is lowercased (BIP 173 forbids mixed
  case, so this is safe and idempotent), base58 and non-addresses are kept byte-exact. One
  payout address is one TIDES row, however each rig's config cases it.
* A gateway's txcount convention (does `txn_count` include the coinbase?) is learned from the
  first share that verifies on a job and pinned for the slot, so `VerifiedShare::commitment`
  is always the header the miner actually ground.
* What a connection can make the Prime hold is bounded: `max-connections` (256) and
  `max-connections-per-ip` (8) at accept; a coinbase section over 20 000 bytes or a ninth
  coinbase id in a slot is refused; only the 16 most recently started job slots keep their
  sections; and `session-coinbase-budget` (4 MiB) caps the total. Coinbaser requests are
  token-bucketed (32, refilled one per second) because each one is a full split over the
  window under the ledger lock, and a session with 2 000 rejects or malformed messages in
  10 s is dropped. Release builds keep `overflow-checks` on.
* The Prime submits every candidate block to its own node as well as trusting the gateway to.
  `duplicate` from `submitblock` is the expected outcome and is recorded as such;
  `inconclusive` means a valid block that is not (yet) the best tip. Records settle when the
  node reports positive confirmations; a record called `orphan:` is re-checked for 100 blocks
  and un-labelled if a reorg brings it back.
