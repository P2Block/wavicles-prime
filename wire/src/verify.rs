//! Pool-side share verification.
//!
//! A DATUM gateway builds its own block template. Prime never sees the transaction list
//! and does not need it: a share carries (once per job slot) the previous block hash,
//! nBits, height, transaction count and the coinbase's merkle branches, plus (once per
//! coinbase variant) the coinbase split into `coinb1`/`coinb2`. From those and the
//! share's own grinding fields Prime rebuilds the exact 164-byte header the miner hashed,
//! and can therefore check two things independently:
//!
//! * the **work** is real — the rebuilt header hashes under the share's target; and
//! * the **coinbase** pays what Prime told the gateway to pay.
//!
//! Everything about *which* transactions the miner chose stays with the miner.
